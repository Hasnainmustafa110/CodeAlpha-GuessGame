Purpose
The game is designed to let users practice logic, input handling, and randomness while enjoying a fun guessing challenge.

Key Features
Random Number Generation

A number between 1 and 100 is randomly selected using the rand() function.
The srand() function ensures randomness is based on the current time, so the number changes every time the program is run.
User Interaction

The user is prompted to guess the randomly chosen number.
Feedback is provided for each guess:
If the guess is too low: "Too low! Try again."
If the guess is too high: "Too high! Try again."
If correct: "Congratulations! You guessed the number!"
Attempts Tracking

The program keeps track of how many attempts it takes for the user to guess the correct number.
This adds an element of challenge and encourages users to aim for fewer attempts.
Game Loop

A while loop ensures the game continues until the correct number is guessed.
The loop uses conditional checks (if-else) to provide feedback after each guess.
Friendly Design

Includes welcoming messages and separators to create an engaging user experience.
Educational Value
This project teaches:

Control Structures: Loops and conditional statements.
Random Number Logic: Using rand(), srand(), and time(0) for randomness.
Input and Output: Handling user input via cin and displaying messages via cout.
Basic Debugging: Identifying off-by-one errors or logic bugs in conditions.
